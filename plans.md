# Plans for An Orcish Incursion: Revised

**SCENARIO 0 [Ka'lian - COMPLETE]:** An initial cutscene scenario that introduces the threat of the orcs on Wesmere. It features a meeting at Ka’lian between Erlornas, Galtrid, and two other lords. Galtrid introduces the scenario byntslking about the rumours of new creatures arriving on the western reaches of Wesmere and cutting down trees, with some sayign they terrorize local villages. I kight compare them to the Drakes that arrived a few years earlier and claim they are about to slaughter their kind. This kight be slightly exaggerated, but elves are still quite wary of humans and were recently attacked by drakes 5 years earlier, so they easily believe these claims. Erlornas of the Greywards volunteers to go east in search of these creatures and banish them from Wesmere.

A first draft of this scenario is complete.

**SCENARIO 1 [Defend the Forest - COMPLETE]:** Mainly based on the current scenario 2, but with some scenario 1 features (e.g. the enmy leader). The map is a slightly revised version of the one used in Scenario 2 of the original. Lomarfel in the orginal is seen onece and alerts of the orcs in Wesmere, but here he is a main character and stays with Erlornas. He is only a scout and not rider to make sure he isn’t too overpowered. The orcs appear to not be causing much harm other than clearing trees, but the elves see this as violent and an intrusion, so they attack. The dialogue will also be fully revised. The elves initially think the creatures are humans, but later discover them to be orcs. Lomarfel should initially follow Erlornas’s order without questioning much, but over time throughout he campaign he sees Erlornas as being increasingly more extreme, though never disobeys him. I currently have this scenario mostly completed, though it needs more revision after the completion of Scenario 0.

**SCENARIO 2:** A revised version of the old Scneario 3 with no villages, this time called "Aleirad". This is the fort where Erlornas was supposed to reach, and he finds the orcs have been clearing some land. It should stay very similar to the old scenario.

**SCENARIO 3:** This is a revised version of Valley of Trolls which I am currently naming Valley of Monsters, though that might change. You can either defeat the troll leader in the south, which is easier, or the drake leader in the nirth, which is harder. The trolls are allied with the orcs, but there are no orcs in this scenario. Erlornas doesn’t like the drakes because of the previous slaughter in Wesmere during WoF, and suspects they are allies with the orcs, although this is not stated. The next scenario changes depending on what leader you defeat, Currently a basic revision of this scenario is in progress.

**SCENARIO 4A:** If you defeat trolls in the last scenario, you find a passage into a cave you use to eacape the drakes. Here you find yourself in a cave exploration scenario. Your goal is to reach the end of the tunnel, but there are trolls, incouding shamans, attacking you. There may be some dwarves nearby. They are enemies of the trolls. You are somewhat wary with the dwarves due to some ancient wars with them, but ultimately let them be because they help you fight the trolls, who you know are allies of the orcs. Defeating the trolls will lead to the dwarvish leader following you in the rest of the campaign.

**SCENARIO 3B:** I still need a good concept here. Most likely a mountain scenario with various enemies, similar to the one in THoT where you used to find the mage. You should be able to find a hero here just like in 4A.

**SCENARIO 4:** Joins together the old scenario 5 and 6 (the first Linaera one and Detour through the Swamp). Like scenario 3A, there’s an optional enemy leader here (orcs), which, if defeated, will allow Linaera to join you in the final. The tower is also now explicitly Spellkeep. However, the main enemy are the undead further away in the swamp. Maybe add a backstroy here, like make the undead mage a former disciple of Linaera who turned away from her. Maybe hint at how Linaera teleported far and wide to find a calm spot to set up the tower, only to find these orcs, which are quite annoying. I also need a motivation for the orcs attacking. Maybe they want magical artifacts inside, or Linaera attacked first?

**SCENARIO 5:** The final battle. Rualsha talks about how the elves slaughtered so many orcs on their way there, and now he must retaliate. Rualsha is killed, but Lomarfel feels Erlornas had been to violent and leaves. Rualsha is revealed to be elader of the Moontusks, and is banished to the Mountains. (The Moontusks are to tie into the LoW Revision slightly). The map should be fairly similar to the original, but the scneairo should be a lot harder. The original one was a bit underwhelming for a finale in my opinion. The epilogue might mention hoe the Greywrads or Erlornas (who traditionally live in the Grey Forest and not Wesmere) became very suspicious of outsiders, including Wesnothians. This might then tie into AToTB.

**OVERALL CHANGES:**

The dialogue will be fully revised, even in the scenarios that stay relatively similar to the original. The difficulty will be sligthly increased. Not that much, but with the introduction of the new TSG revision there is less need for this to be a tutorial campaign, so it will be a bit harder than the original. Achievements will be added for beating some of the optional leaders, and finding secrets in scenario 4A (which will be full of small ones, and a few might give achievements).

I will be proposing this rework to mainline, though I don't expect it to be added. I still hope this rework will be enjoyable once released, and hopefully improve on the original.
